Frisbee is a small utility to collect email addresses from search engines and
other free-form text sources. Frisbee makes it simple to find email addresses
posted on the web by taking user-fed input and translating it into an
automated search query. Users can extend frisbee by adding modules for new
search engines or other obscure data sources.

For detailed explanations of the library, please see the wiki_.
